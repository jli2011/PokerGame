# PokerGame
This game follows the same rules as real poker. At the start of the game, the user is given 5 random cards. The user is then asked to remove 3 cards or 0 cards. If the user chooses to remove 3 cards, 3 random cards are then given to replace the ones that have been removed. The program then calculates the remaining cards to determine whether the user won or lost.
